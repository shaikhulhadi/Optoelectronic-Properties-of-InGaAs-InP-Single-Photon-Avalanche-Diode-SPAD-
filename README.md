# Optoelectronic Properties of InGaAs/InP Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)

## Purpose
This work analyze simulated Dark count probabilities for varying single photon detection efficiency and Photocurrent variation with applied different temperature for InGaAs/InP basd SPAD.

Published experimental work , *Gigahertz-gated InGaAs/InP single-photon detector with detection efficiency exceeding 55% at 1550 nm[^1] * and *Dark count probability and quantum efficiency of avalanche photodiodes for single-photon detection[^2]* used as reference data to compare.

## How to run:
**`commander_final.m`** and **`Kang/Kang_final.m`** simulate final output. Tune relevent semiconductor variable values to simulate intendet semiconductor properties.

This project also content other matlab files relavent to analyze individal informations that were necessary for the research but may not end up in final work[^3].
